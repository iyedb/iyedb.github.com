Any non trivial C++ or C program requires some kind of build system. There 
are many of them available: cmake, waf, scons, and many others. You can even
roll your own. Problem is that you need to learn the "language" of that build 
system, its rules, conventions and so one. But clearly, you usally don't want
to spend that much time on that task in the beginning of your project and you 
would like focus on your software first. On the other hand getting a properly 
working and correct build system is necessary as I already said for any non 
trivial system. In this post I present a simple Makefile. You can use it 
almost as is when you start coding you C or C++ program. The most important 
feature is that it 
[automatically generates the dependencies](http://make.mad-scientist.net/papers/advanced-auto-dependency-generation/) between your 
source files. So why make (or gmake actually) and not any other build tool?
Make is huge and is not simple at all. Well, it is widely used (Android build 
system is entirely build on Makefiles for example) and widely available even 
on Windows. You can of course read a "tutorial" on make but most of the time 
those tutorials on scratch the surface of the art of creating a __correct__ 
Makefile. Ok now here is the Makefile: Please read the inline comments to 
understand how it structured.
